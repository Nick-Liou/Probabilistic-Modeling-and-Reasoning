# Probabilistic-Modeling-and-Reasoning-HW2
A repository for solution to the problems of:
- Ploting a graph
- Given a Belief network and it's CPT (Conditional Probability Tables) compute the conditional probability P(A=a âˆ£ B=b)
- Given two belief networks represented as DAGs with associated adjacency matrices, state if they are Markov equivalent.
